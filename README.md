### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

ðŸŒ± I'm a proactive and adaptable web developer with a growing passion for data science. After two decades working as a railway signalling designer, I'm now exploring new opportunities in software engineering â€” building on my strong foundation of problem-solving, precision, and attention to detail. I enjoy creating innovative, meaningful solutions and thrive on tackling challenging problems. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and deepen my expertise, drawing on my transferrable skills to contribute effectively in this new field.

## ðŸ˜„ About Me 

I'm a proactive and adaptable web developer with a growing passion for data science. I enjoy creating innovative, meaningful solutions and thrive on tackling challenging problems. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and deepen my expertise.

### Key Skills:
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Database management:** MySQL, SQlite, SQL Alchemy ORM

- **NLP:** spaCY
- **Data Analysis:** data cleaning and preprocessing- handling missing values and inconsistent data entry, scaling and normalisation, parsing dates
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, PowerBI
- **Tools:** Machine Learning, DBMS


## ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning

I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and exploring new domains. Currently, I'm focusing on SigRec, a web application for the management of signalling records drawing on over two decades of experience in a design office and studying for my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

**Key Concepts:**
- Application factory pattern (create_app)
- Modular Flask blueprint architecture
- Form multi-row processing
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database modeling
- Record deduplication and error handling
- Basic user feedback with flask.flash
- Render deployment with environment variables
   
**Languages:**
- Python (Backend)
- HTML, CSS (Frontend templating)
- Jinja2 (Templating engine)
  
**Frameworks and libraries:**
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Bootstrap (via CDN)
  
**Cloud Platforms:**
 - Render â€” hosting & deployment
 - GitHub â€” version control
 - SQLite (via Flask SQLAlchemy) â€” file-based database (non-persistent across deploys)


## ðŸ”­ Projects

## ðŸš¦ SigRec â€“ Signalling Records Web App
Tech Stack: Flask â€¢ SQLite â€¢ SQLAlchemy â€¢ Jinja2 â€¢ Bootstrap â€¢ Gunicorn â€¢ Render

SigRec is a Flask-based web app for managing signalling records used in a design office. It began as a database capstone project and evolved into a full-stack web application with plans for future enhancements.

### ðŸ“Œ Project History

### Phase 1: Database Design & Recovery
Originally built during the CFG Data & SQL course using MySQL, the first version focused on designing a relational database for signalling records. After losing most original files during a computer transfer, I recovered and rebuilt the schema from a .mwb model. Using mysql.connector, pandas, and os, I automated importing legacy .csv data and resolved schema mismatches and data inconsistencies.

### Phase 2: Flask Wev App Development  
Inspired by the CFG Full Stack Bootcamp, I transitioned the project into a web app using Flask. I learned and implemented key concepts like routing, templates (Jinja2), ORM (SQLAlchemy), and UI design (Bootstrap), building a modular and scalable app structure with proper error handling and forms.

### Phase 3: Deployment & Refinement
I deployed the app on Render using Gunicorn as the WSGI server. For simplicity, I switched to SQLite for deployment, with plans to migrate to PostgreSQL for better long-term scalability. Environment variables are used for secure config management.
Planned improvements include:
- Adding a secure user login system with role-based access for different teams (Design, Record Control, Management).
- Full implementation of the Design and Management modules to complement the fully functional Record Control system.
- Migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL to ensure long-term data persistence and scalability.


## Natural Language Processing - Creating a 'Netflix Recommendation System' in Python with spaCy: watch_next.py

The objective of this project is to develop a Netflix recommendation system using natural language processing techniques in Python. The system compares the similarity between a given movie description and a collection of other movie descriptions to generate personalised recommendations.

## Python Variables and Control Structures project: finance_calculators.py

This task required creating a program that allows the user to access two financial calculators: an investment calculator (where there is a choice of simple or compound interest) and a home loan repayment calculator based on information provided (interest rate, number of years invested/ needed for the repayment, simple or compound interest). 

## Hangman Python game : hangman.py

Independent project to strengthen my understanding of OOP concepts learned during the CFG boot camp by creating a class-based Hangman game.
