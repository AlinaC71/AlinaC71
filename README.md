## 🔭 Projects

### Natural Language Processing: Creating a 'Netflix Recommendation System' in Python with spaCy

The objective of this project is to develop a Netflix recommendation system using natural language processing techniques in Python. The system compares the similarity between a given movie description and a collection of other movie descriptions to generate personalised recommendations.

### Python Variables and Control Structures project: finance_calculators.py

This task required creating a program that allows the user to access two financial calculators: an investment calculator (where there is a choice of simple or compound interest) and a home loan repayment calculator based on information provided (interest rate, number of years invested/ needed for the repayment, simple or compound interest).
