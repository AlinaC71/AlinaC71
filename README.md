### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

ðŸŒ± I am currently seeking an opportunity to apply the solid foundations acquired through the CFG Full Stack and HyperionDev Data Science bootcamps in a professional work environment.
Here are just a few of the projects I have worked on during the boot camps and independently afterwards.

## ðŸ˜„ About Me 

I am a resourceful web developer and budding data scientist with a strong interest in building innovative and impactful solutions. I love exploring new technologies and solving complex problems. My areas of expertise include:

- **Programming languages:** Python, MySQL
- **Frameworks and libraries:** numPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKLearn, spaCy 
- **Tools and technologies:** Machine Learning, DBMS

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning

I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and exploring new domains. Currently, I'm focusing on the following:

- **Programming languages:** R, C++, C#.NET
- **Frameworks and libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, JAX
- **Tools and technologies:** Microsoft Azure, Ivy


## ðŸ”­ Projects

### Natural Language Processing: Creating a 'Netflix Recommendation System' in Python with spaCy

The objective of this project is to develop a Netflix recommendation system using natural language processing techniques in Python. The system compares the similarity between a given movie description and a collection of other movie descriptions to generate personalised recommendations.

### Python Variables and Control Structures project: finance_calculators.py

This task required creating a program that allows the user to access two financial calculators: an investment calculator (where there is a choice of simple or compound interest) and a home loan repayment calculator based on information provided (interest rate, number of years invested/ needed for the repayment, simple or compound interest). 

### Hangman Python game : hangman.py

Independent project to strengthen my understanding of OOP concepts learned during the CFG boot camp by creating a class-based Hangman game.
